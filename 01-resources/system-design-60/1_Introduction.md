Day 1: Introduction to System Design

Goal: To understand the basics of system design, its importance, common challenges, and the key principle involved.

1. What is System Design?
System Design is the process of defining the architechture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a sytem to satisty specified requirements. Since it focuses on how to structure and build a system that is efficient, scalable, and maintainable, it is regarded as an essential aspect of software development.

Terms:
Architecture: Overall structure and design of the system.
Components: Individual parts if the system, such as databases, APIs, load balancers, servers etc.
Modules: Specific units or functions within the system, such as user authentication or message queues.
Interfaces: Points of interaction between different system components.

2. Why System Design?
Scalability: Allows the system to scale (horizontally or vertically) ensuring that it can handle increased load as traffic grows.
Reliability: A well-designed system is fault-tolerant and continue to operate even when some components fail.
Maintainability: Desiging systems in a modular and structured way makes them easier to maintain and update over time.
performance: Improves response times, minimized latency and maximizes throughput
